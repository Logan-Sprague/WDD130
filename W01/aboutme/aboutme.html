      Hi, my name is Logan Sprague. I am getting a bachelor's in Marriage and
      Family studies and a minor in Computer Information Technology. I know this
      is a weird combination. My father is a systems administrator for Oregon State 
      University. I was planning to go into IT and even did an internship for it. 
      After my mission I decided that I wanted to go into the field of therapy. I 
      did not want to lose my IT skills so I decided to get a minor in Computer 
      Information Technology.

    <p>I grew up in the countryside near Corvallis, Oregon. I live with my wife in
      Bountiful, Utah. We have been married for almost 2 years now. I enjoy reading, 
      playing video games with my wife, and fishing. I grew up fishing in the ocean 
      so I am having to learn more about lake fishing here in Utah.</p>

      The above photo is me and my wife at the Oregon Coast aquarium a few weeks
      ago. We visited my family and spent a few days at the beach. It is hard to
      live so far from the ocean in Utah. We try to visit Oregon at least once a
      year to see family and the Ocean.
