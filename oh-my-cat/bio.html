        <h2>A hard start</h2>
        <p>
          Bucky had a hard start to life. He was found by my wife’s grandfather
          in their shed as a kitten. This was in the July heat of Utah and
          thankfully he was found and saved. We think he was the runt of his
          litter and was possibly abandoned by his mother. One theory is that he
          enjoys biting anything that is sticking out. His favorites are noses
          and ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the possible heat stroke Bucky is a perma-kitten. At age 10
          he still acts like he is a new kitten. This also caused his growth to
          be stunted as he weighs a total of 10 lbs.

          The photo to the right is Bucky when he was a kitten. He fit into the palm of
          most people's hands at the time.

        <h2>How Bucky became part of the family</h2>
        <p>
          After my wife’s grandfather found Bucky, he ended up at my wife’s
          family’s house. They were not planning to keep him long-term but My
          wife’s great grandmother had other Ideas. While taking family photos
          the great grandmother pulled bucky out of her shirt where she smuggled
          him to be a part of family photos. This solidified his place in the
          family. The below photo is my wife and her great grandmother at this
          event (permission was granted from my wife to post the photo and her
          great grandmother passed away last year).
