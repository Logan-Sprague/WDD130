        <h2>Bucky's Favorite Activities</h2>
        <p>
          Buckyâ€™s favorite activities include eating plants. If there is a plant
          in the house, he will try to eat it. My wife and I have been forced to
          hide or get rid of any plants that may be harmful to cats since Bucky
          thinks they are the yummiest. This includes but is not limited to
          daisies and avocado plants. The photos associated are of plants at my
          in-laws house that Bucky found to be tasty.

        <h2>Bucky thinks he is a dog</h2>
        <p>
          Bucky grew up in a house of dogs. In his life Bucky has only met two
          cats. As such he has more dog-like mannerisms. This includes play
          fighting with the dogs and responding in the most joyful way to being
          called a good doggy. Notable dogs that Bucky has lived with are a
          German shepherd, a labradoodle, and a French bulldog. Bucky plays most
          with the French bulldog (lovingly named hippo). Hippo will flip Bucky
          all the way over while fighting, and Bucky will cling to his back.
