        This website is dedicated to the life and happenings of James Buchannan Barnes, more commonly known as Bucky. This website will focus on some background on Bucky as well as his funnier behaviors. The website is meant to be comical in nature but all of the stories and photos are real. 
        Feel free to browse the bio page as well as the shenanigans page for photos and stories of bucky the cat. Every photo posted will have a description and story behind it.

      <h3>Bio</h3>
      <h4>  A hard start</h4>
      <p>
Bucky had a hard start to life. He was found by my wife’s grandfather in their shed as a kitten. This was in the July heat of Utah and thankfully he was found and saved. We think he was the runt of his litter and was possibly abandoned by his mother. One theory is that he enjoys biting anything that is sticking out. His favorites are noses and ears. 
</p>
<p>Because of the possible heat stroke Bucky is a perma-kitten. At age 10 he still acts like he is a new kitten. This also caused his growth to be stunted as he weighs a total of 10 lbs. <p>
  <h4>How Bucky became part of the family</h4>
<p>  After my wife’s grandfather found Bucky, he ended up at my wife’s family’s house. They were not planning to keep him long-term but My wife’s great grandmother had other Ideas. While taking family photos the great grandmother pulled bucky out of her shirt where she smuggled him to be a part of family photos. This solidified his place in the family. The below photo is my wife and her great grandmother at this event (permission was granted from my wife to post the photo and her great grandmother passed away last year). </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Shenanigans</h3>
      <h4>plants</h4>
      <p>
Bucky’s favorite activities include eating plants. If there is a plant in the house, he will try to eat it. My wife and I have been forced to hide or get rid of any plants that may be harmful to cats since Bucky thinks they are the yummiest. This includes but is not limited to daisies and avocado plants. The photos associated are of plants at my in-laws house that Bucky found to be tasty.
      </p>
      <h4>Thinking he is a dog</h4>
      <p>
        Bucky grew up in a house of dogs. In his life Bucky has only met two cats. As such he has more dog-like mannerisms. This includes play fighting with the dogs and responding in the most joyful way to being called a good doggy. Notable dogs that Bucky has lived with are a German shepherd, a labradoodle, and a French bulldog. Bucky plays most with the French bulldog (lovingly named hippo). Hippo will flip Bucky all the way over while fighting, and Bucky will cling to his back.
